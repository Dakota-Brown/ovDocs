# OneVision Resources Marketing Systems Documentation

This is a documentation site that I (Dakota) have spun up after being brought onto the team as an integration engineer/marketing specialist/any and all things that are needed. The purpose of this site is to document our systems in a manner that would allow future new hires to be able to understand the systems better. This includes Tray.io documentation, which Tray does not really provide, as well as specific details on our use cases with ActiveCampaign, Charigy, Zendesk, and anything else that comes along the way.

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at the side bar for different pages based on what you are looking for. In the future, I plan on adding a general tutorial process to flow through, but for now, just explore.
